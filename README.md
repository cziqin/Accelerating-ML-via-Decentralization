# Accelerating Optimization and Machine Learning via Decentralization
All of existing studies commonly perceived that the convergence speed of a decentralized optimization algorithm is always slower than, or at best equal to, its centralized counterpart. We find that, surprisingly, decentralizing optimization can lead to faster convergence, outperforming the centralized counterpart by reducing the number of iterations needed to achieve the optimal solution.

## Installation Tutorial and Preliminaries
### Install Setup
1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/cziqin/Accelerating-Optimization-and-Machine-Learning-via-Decentralization/tree/main)
2. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) (if you don't have it already)
3. Create a new virtual environment with python 3.12, take conda as an example:
   ```shell
   conda create -n accelerate python=3.12
   conda activate accelerate
   ```
4. Install any additional packages you need in this environment using conda or pip:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Hardware/computing resources
The experiments were conducted using the Windows 11 OS equipped with a 32-core CPU, 32GB RAM, and one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB VRAM.
